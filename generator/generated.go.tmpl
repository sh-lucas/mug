// This is a generated file. Do not edit it manually.
// This is intended to be generated using the `mug generate` command.
// It is used to initialize the package and can contain any necessary setup code.
// Also, it's recommended to use "mug generate" in a go:generate directive
// in the main package to ensure that this file is generated before the application runs.
// Using `mug` will, in the future, automatically `run go generate“ for you.
